My name is Asaf Mohammed. I'm an Data Engineer and AI enthusiast. I'm from Chennai, India.
I love all foods, particularly South Indian food. 
My hobbies are learning new tech, working out, creating memes.
I love playing football. I am an avid Aviation Enthusiast, Observer of geo politics and read a lot about Psychology and human behaviour.

Of all my projects, I consider Email Validation Automation as the flagship one since I had to integrate multiple APIs. Followed by, the Salesforce Utils script which has been adapted immediately by other teams.

My key skills are Python, SQL, Tableau, Prompt engineering , Excel along with basic PySpark. Also I have a knowledge of Data Modeling - Star Schema, snowflake schema, SCD etc.,

I also have a good grasp in workflow automation tool called N8N. I have been interested in AI automation and Workflow Automation recently and been working consistently on it.

I have been exploring agentic AI concepts and frameworks like OpenAI SDK and CrewAI.
In the n8n front, I don't have much projects in my portfolio yet, but currently exploring more on that.

Since I have experience in creating workflows programmatically, I believe n8n is easier.
I have one project which I had made on inbound lead response workflow.

I have also worked on no code tools like Replit, Lovable, Bolt and created few apps, though not deployed.
